# Video Sharing Platform

## Important

**lol Vercelâ€™s request body limit is around 4 MB for serverless functions.**  
Unless I change the deployment server, the video upload limit will remain at **4MB**.

## Currently Under Development

A platform where users can upload and showcase their videos, allowing others to discover and engage with their content. Share your creativity and connect with a community that appreciates your unique perspective on video entertainment.

- **Accepted Formats**: `mp4`, `mov`, `avi`, `mkv`, `wmv`, `flv`
- **File Size Limit**: 100MB
